# ProjectArtevelde-ToDo
Leveled up a basic to-do list into a database-driven app in 6 weeks! Used MVC architecture for clean code &amp; integrated a database for persistent tasks. Explored CRUD operations &amp; mailing system. A project that boosted my web dev skills!

## 6-Week To-Do Transformation: From Simple List to Powerful App (Artevelde UAS)

Over 6 intensive weeks at Artevelde University of Applied Sciences, I embarked on a project that transformed a simple to-do list into a robust web application. This journey wasn't just about building a productivity tool; it served as a deep dive into the world of web development, specifically exploring the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, database interaction, and integrating a mailing system. 

**Building the Foundation (Weeks 1-2):**

The initial weeks focused on laying the groundwork. Utilizing Handlebars, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Knex.js, I constructed the core structure and functionality of the to-do list application. This involved creating a user interface for adding, displaying, and marking tasks as complete.

**MVC Integration: Separation of Concerns (Weeks 3-4):**

Weeks 3 and 4 marked a turning point as I implemented the MVC architecture. This powerful design pattern separates the application into three distinct layers:

* **Model:** This layer represents the data itself, including the structure of tasks and their properties (e.g., title, description, due date).
* **View:** This layer encompasses the user interface, responsible for displaying the to-do list items and allowing user interaction. I leveraged **Handlebars**, a templating engine, to dynamically render the user interface based on data provided by the model.
* **Controller:** This layer acts as the intermediary, handling user interactions and manipulating the data model. The controller interacts with both the Model and View layers to ensure the application functions seamlessly.

**Database Connection: Persistent Tasks (Week 5):**

Week 5 saw the magic happen. Here, I connected the application to a database using **Knex.js**, a popular library for interacting with SQL databases. This enabled persistent storage of tasks, ensuring that users' to-do lists wouldn't disappear with each browser refresh. Knex facilitated querying and manipulating the database, ensuring efficient data management within the application.

**CRUD Operations & Integrated Mailing System (Week 6):**

The final week focused on implementing fundamental functionalities for managing tasks within the database. I implemented **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations, allowing users to add new tasks, view existing ones, update their details, and mark them as completed. Additionally, I integrated a mailing system to further enhance the application's functionality. This could involve sending email reminders for upcoming tasks, ensuring users stay on top of their deadlines.

**Learning Outcomes: A Springboard for Growth**

This 6-week project at Artevelde UAS proved to be a valuable learning experience. It provided hands-on practice with:

* **MVC Architecture:**  Understanding the separation of concerns within a web application.
* **Database Interaction with Knex.js:**  Learning to connect and interact with a database using Knex for efficient data management.
* **Templating with Handlebars:**  Utilizing Handlebars to dynamically render the user interface based on data.
* **CRUD Operations:**  Implementing essential operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks within the database.
* **Mailing System Integration:**  Exploring the integration of a mailing system for sending email reminders.

This project wasn't just about code; it was about building a full-fledged web application with real-world functionalities. It served as a springboard for further exploration within the vast world of web development, equipping me with the knowledge and skills to tackle more complex projects in the future.
